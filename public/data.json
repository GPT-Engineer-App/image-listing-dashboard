The woman's face is more prominently shown, with her eyes closed and a serene expression. She is wearing a silver headpiece, and her makeup is subtle with a focus on her eyes and lips. The background is blurred, emphasizing the subjects, and the lighting is soft, creating a warm and intimate atmosphere.",
